# Cyoda UI components library (with Storybook)

Inspired by [Vue Design System](https://vueds.com)

## Why components library?

It is easy to reuse those components across multiple apps. Keeping library in separate package helps to separate presentational components from components that are mostly about business logic. 

We could use third-party library to start things faster. But from the experience, it often takes more time to customize simple stuff than to write a component from scratch. Having our own components library gives us full control over components' features, styling, semantics, a11y and basically any other aspect.
